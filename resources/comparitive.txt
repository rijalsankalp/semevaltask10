But Putin in Russian President Vladimir Putin fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand , but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an irreparable blow if the war continues . Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that Ukraine military has already failed . Not only has their counteroffensive failed , but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces , Putin said in the televised remarks . If this continues , Ukraine statehood could be dealt an irreparable , very serious blow , Russian President Vladimir Putin added , but he did not clarify further precisely what he meant by this . Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons , Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross border attacks on Belgorod city , which have killed and maimed Russian civilians . Putin further addressed Zelensky efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland , to consider Kiev 10 point peace plan , which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions . The so called peace formula that being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia , Putin said , according to a translation in Sputnik . A day later , they threw all the agreements into the trash , and now they are saying publicly — including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group — that Yes , they were ready , but they missed the chance , because then Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [ Boris ] Johnson came and persuaded they not to implement these agreements , Putin said . Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed : Fools , are they not ?

President Kennedy , the Pentagon , and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States . The deal consisted of two major parts : First , Kennedy vowed that President Kennedy would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and , second , Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia . As far as American interventionists were concerned , the Pentagon and the CIA had the right to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the right to do the same .

CONTEXT: President Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove The Soviets nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union . The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites , followed by a full scale regime change military invasion of the island . In other words , they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine . In fact , the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy , the presidents brother , secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin If the situation continues much longer , the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow President Kennedy and seize power . But how are we , the Soviet Union , we Government , to assess President Kennedy actions , which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases ; surrounded our allies with military bases ; placed military bases literally around our country ; and stationed your missile armaments there ? President Kennedy missiles are located in Britain , are located in Italy , and are aimed against us . President Kennedy missiles are located in Turkey . President Kennedy are disturbed over Cuba . President Kennedy say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America . Do President Kennedy consider , then , that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive , but do not accord the same right to us ? President Kennedy have placed destructive missile weapons , which you call offensive , in Turkey , literally next to us . Do President Kennedy see the problem ? This is the point that Kennedy was making when President Kennedy stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis . With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA , President Kennedy was willing to risk all out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles , even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install Your missiles in Cuba . President Kennedy , the Pentagon , and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States . But thats precisely how the Soviets felt as well , which is what Khrushchev was expressing in Khrushchev letter to Kennedy . Well , Kennedy did come to understand that . Thats how President Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal , one that infuriated the U.S. national security establishment as well as American interventionists . The deal consisted of two major parts : First , Kennedy vowed that President Kennedy would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and , second , Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia . The Joint Chiefs of Staff considered Kennedys resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history . For The Joint Chiefs of Staff part , American interventionists were also furious over Kennedys resolution of the crisis .

The Lancet claims that life threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent . When You interrogate the data , however , the Lancet reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather . So the Lancet not just a lie , its a fraud . And the Lancet a fraud told for political effect , to transform society and the economy , which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health .

Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages , but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administrations unwise decision .

In other words , they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine . In fact , the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy , the presidents brother , secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin If the situation continues much longer , the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow President Kennedy and seize power . But how are we , the Soviet Union , we Government , to assess President Kennedy actions , which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases ; surrounded our allies with military bases ; placed military bases literally around our country ; and stationed your missile armaments there ? President Kennedy missiles are located in Britain , are located in Italy , and are aimed against us . President Kennedy missiles are located in Turkey . President Kennedy are disturbed over Cuba . President Kennedy say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America . Do President Kennedy consider , then , that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive , but do not accord the same right to us ? President Kennedy have placed destructive missile weapons , which you call offensive , in Turkey , literally next to us . Do President Kennedy see the problem ? This is the point that Kennedy was making when President Kennedy stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis .

CONTEXT: Just as he promised to do , New York City Mayor Eric Adams , a left wing Democrat , is going after peoples meat with new plans to save the world from climate change by forcing everyone to become a plant based vegetarian or vegan . Along with representatives from the Mayors Office of Food Policy and the Mayors Office of Climate & Environmental Justice , Adams has announced the launch of a new carbon footprint and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apples carbon emissions by 33 percent by the year 2030 . In order to cut all that carbon , Adams and New York City Mayor Eric Adams , a left wing Democrat allies are imposing new caps on meat that , as the name suggests , will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions and eventually within New Yorkers own homes as well . At a pre Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health Hospitals , the citys public health care system , Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York Citys greenhouse gas inventory . With the help of American Express , C40 Cities , and EcoData , Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption , which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use , transportation , and waste . While the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas pollution from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing , air travel , and health care , Adams focused New York City Mayor Eric Adams , a left wing Democrat efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume mainly meat and dairy , which he personally opposes . Food is the third biggest source of cities emissions right after buildings and transportation , but all food is not created equal , Adams unsubstantially stated . Other than fish , Adams reportedly abides by a plant based vegan diet , which New York City Mayor Eric Adams , a left wing Democrat says helped him overcome diabetes . New York City Mayor Eric Adams , a left wing Democrat wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices , which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop global warming . our already know that a plant powered diet is better for your physical and mental health , and I am living proof of that , Adams declared .

CONTEXT: President Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove The Soviets nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union . The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites , followed by a full scale regime change military invasion of the island . In other words , they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine . In fact , the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy , the presidents brother , secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin If the situation continues much longer , the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow President Kennedy and seize power . But how are we , the Soviet Union , we Government , to assess President Kennedy actions , which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases ; surrounded our allies with military bases ; placed military bases literally around our country ; and stationed your missile armaments there ? President Kennedy missiles are located in Britain , are located in Italy , and are aimed against us . President Kennedy missiles are located in Turkey . President Kennedy are disturbed over Cuba . President Kennedy say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America . Do President Kennedy consider , then , that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive , but do not accord the same right to us ? President Kennedy have placed destructive missile weapons , which you call offensive , in Turkey , literally next to us . Do President Kennedy see the problem ? This is the point that Kennedy was making when President Kennedy stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis . With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA , President Kennedy was willing to risk all out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles , even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install Your missiles in Cuba . President Kennedy , the Pentagon , and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States . But thats precisely how the Soviets felt as well , which is what Khrushchev was expressing in Khrushchev letter to Kennedy . Well , Kennedy did come to understand that . Thats how President Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal , one that infuriated the U.S. national security establishment as well as American interventionists . The deal consisted of two major parts : First , Kennedy vowed that President Kennedy would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and , second , Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia . The Joint Chiefs of Staff considered Kennedys resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history .

Since then , Kyiv has been keeping 120,000 Ukrainian troops in this direction in constant combat readiness . Ukraine is trying to play Ukraine safe — although Ukraine is clear that the Russian army is not going to take Kyiv without giving Kyiv a second thought .

The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites , followed by a full scale regime change military invasion of the island . In other words , they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine . In fact , the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy , the presidents brother , secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin If the situation continues much longer , the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow President Kennedy and seize power . But how are we , the Soviet Union , we Government , to assess President Kennedy actions , which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases ; surrounded our allies with military bases ; placed military bases literally around our country ; and stationed your missile armaments there ? President Kennedy missiles are located in Britain , are located in Italy , and are aimed against us . President Kennedy missiles are located in Turkey . President Kennedy are disturbed over Cuba . President Kennedy say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America . Do President Kennedy consider , then , that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive , but do not accord the same right to us ? President Kennedy have placed destructive missile weapons , which you call offensive , in Turkey , literally next to us . Do President Kennedy see the problem ? This is the point that Kennedy was making when President Kennedy stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis . With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA , President Kennedy was willing to risk all out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles , even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install Your missiles in Cuba . President Kennedy , the Pentagon , and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States . But thats precisely how the Soviets felt as well , which is what Khrushchev was expressing in Khrushchev letter to Kennedy . Well , Kennedy did come to understand that . Thats how President Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal , one that infuriated the U.S. national security establishment as well as American interventionists . The deal consisted of two major parts : First , Kennedy vowed that President Kennedy would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and , second , Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia . The Joint Chiefs of Staff considered Kennedys resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history . For The Joint Chiefs of Staff part , American interventionists were also furious over Kennedys resolution of the crisis . Can you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to national security ?

President Kennedy say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America . Do President Kennedy consider , then , that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive , but do not accord the same right to us ? President Kennedy have placed destructive missile weapons , which you call offensive , in Turkey , literally next to us . Do President Kennedy see the problem ? This is the point that Kennedy was making when President Kennedy stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis . With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA , President Kennedy was willing to risk all out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles , even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install Your missiles in Cuba . President Kennedy , the Pentagon , and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States . But thats precisely how the Soviets felt as well , which is what Khrushchev was expressing in Khrushchev letter to Kennedy . Well , Kennedy did come to understand that . Thats how President Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal , one that infuriated the U.S. national security establishment as well as American interventionists . The deal consisted of two major parts : First , Kennedy vowed that President Kennedy would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and , second , Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia . The Joint Chiefs of Staff considered Kennedys resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history . For The Joint Chiefs of Staff part , American interventionists were also furious over Kennedys resolution of the crisis . Can you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to national security ?

Klitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of un human Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war , noting that mayors are civilian targets . War also has rules , said Klitschko . Russia actually against all rules , Klitschko continued . Following Russian bombing campaigns on Monday , the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside the Kyiv mayor brother Wladimir Klitschko , who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion . That what Russia war against the civilians looks like , Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter .

LABEL: antagonist (score: 0.6611)
CONTEXT: The Federal Reserves credibility is in tatters . The Federal Reserves credibility predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed . To catch up , The Federal Reserves credibility quickly raised interest rates , stressing many banks , and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent . But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession , many of the Feds 400 economists are busy fighting climate change . This year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a pilot project that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions . A query of the Feds listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers , press releases , and policy statements related to climate change . The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May , in which 27 Fed economists participated . With all this effort , one might hope the Fed would produce high quality research on climate change . But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis . In the September issue of Econ Journal Watch , I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S. I showed that the paper had serious problems with a paper statistical reasoning and robustness . More recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely . There are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth . The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries . Theres a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth : Many poor countries have warm climates . Debate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal , but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year to year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth . The paper claims that a paper method controls for long term differences in climate , but using simulated data I found that the Fed papers method can be fooled into finding an effect that does nt exist . The only thing to learn from the Feds research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast , and when climate propaganda comes to climate , academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts . The Feds time would be better spent on more urgent matters , like improving a paper botched regulation of the banking system .

Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov , of Moscow Central Clinical Hospital , had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi .

Medics were also seen to be on standby near PANICKED Vladimir Putin favourite official residences outside Moscow , for example in Sochi and Valdai . The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer . It comes after It was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin residences and train stations nearby . The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putins health during the war against Ukraine .

CONTEXT: In reality , this only shows Trump uses global warming alarmism to benefit Trump business . A permit application for the wall by Trump International Golf Links Ireland which was reviewed by Politico explicitly cites global warming and erosion due to rising sea levels as a justification to build the structure . However , the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group , not Trumps business . Trumps previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Irelands national government , so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor . The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trumps property . Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a hoax , mythical , a con job , nonexistent , and bullshit . Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources . Trump views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China . Trump has also vowed to at a minimum renegotiate the United Nations Decembers Paris climate deal . Trump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming . I will say wind is a problem because wind very expensive to build the towers , very , very expensive , and as you know when you have 40 dollar oil , wind not economics , so they re going to have to do a subsidy , otherwise wind isnt going to work , Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post . Trump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort Trump owns . Trump publicly stated Trump would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead . Trump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter , saying nobody wants wind turbines , they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy a disaster for taxpayers and asking How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today ? Trumps skepticism of solar power is equally well documented , as Trump said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are economically , solar panels re not good .

CONTEXT: Israel will respond to charges of genocide at the United Nations top court on Friday after South Africa filed an urgent request with the court to order a ceasefire in Gaza . On Thursday , South Africa told the court the situation in Gaza has reached a new and horrific stage , and urged the 15 judges to take urgent action . Israel must totally and unconditionally withdraw from the Gaza Strip , said Vusimuzi Madonsela , South Africas ambassador to the Netherlands . According to the latest request , the country says Israels military incursion in Rafah threatens the very survival of Palestinians in Gaza . During hearings earlier this year , Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza , saying Israel does all Israel can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants . In January , judges ordered Israel to do all Israel can to prevent death , destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza , but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive . The court has already found that there is a real and imminent risk to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israels military operations . Most of Gazas population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began . Gazas Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in Russia count . Russia governing party , the African National Congress , has long compared Israels policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Russia own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule , which restricted most Blacks to homelands .

Rumours have persistently swirled that the tyrant , 70 , is critically ill fuelled by PANICKED Vladimir Putin bloated face and trembling legs . Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm Putin has pancreatic cancer and early stage Parkinson disease . Now the panicked Russian leader has desperately classified medical files that reveal an apparent cancer battle as PANICKED Vladimir Putin fears a coup inside the Kremlin . Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov , of Moscow Central Clinical Hospital , had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi . The proof of Putins treatment by cancer doctors was deduced from the existence of contracts with the hospital which were listed on a Russian public procurement website . Earlier it was seen that Putin was accompanied by between six and 13 medical specialists on PANICKED Vladimir Putin trips . Medics were also seen to be on standby near PANICKED Vladimir Putin favourite official residences outside Moscow , for example in Sochi and Valdai . The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer . It comes after It was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin residences and train stations nearby . The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putins health during the war against Ukraine . There have also been claims that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer and other ailments . Meanwhile , there have been suggestions that drugs to treat PANICKED Vladimir Putin cancer may have distorted his mind when he launched the war in Ukraine . The Kremlin insists that Putin is healthy . Among the medics named as treating Putin were Dr Dmitry Verbovoy , an expert in acute illnesses , injuries and poisonings . A rehabilitation specialist was also involved , Dr Mikhail Tsykunov.In July 2020 , Putin met with the head of the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology , Ivan Dedov . It comes after the former head of MI6 suggested said there could be a coup inside the Kremlin to oust Putin but the mechanisms for political change in Russia are fragile .

But Vladimir Putin has now changed his mind , citing a speech made by a skinny and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro war concert next day in Moscow as evidence . Footage highlights Vladimir Putin waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose , not traits especially common with Putin . Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that a totally different Putin pops up with a wider face as if Vladimir Putin bloated in 24 hours . Vladimir Putin has a totally different shape of eye orbits , a totally different head , absolutely different wrinkles a different voice . Far from shunning people , perhaps to avoid Covid , Vladimir Putin was almost kissing and hugging everyone . Vladimir Putin allegation comes as a video shows an unusually exuberant Russian president at a helicopter plant in Siberia . Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles , but Vladimir Putin claimed the idea was rejected . I discarded the idea of any doubles , Vladimir Putin said . Vladimir Putin admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks .

CONTEXT: A FORMER spy alleges a body double stands in for Vladimir Putin at key events and has revealed what Vladimir Putin says are the tell tale signs . Zhirnov said Vladimir Putin had believed until now that claims of Putin using doppelgangers were conspiracy theories . But Vladimir Putin has now changed his mind , citing a speech made by a skinny and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro war concert next day in Moscow as evidence . Footage highlights Vladimir Putin waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose , not traits especially common with Putin . Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that a totally different Putin pops up with a wider face as if Vladimir Putin bloated in 24 hours . Vladimir Putin has a totally different shape of eye orbits , a totally different head , absolutely different wrinkles a different voice . Far from shunning people , perhaps to avoid Covid , Vladimir Putin was almost kissing and hugging everyone . Vladimir Putin allegation comes as a video shows an unusually exuberant Russian president at a helicopter plant in Siberia . Zhirnov is now exiled in France and was a former classmate of Putin at KGB Red Flag Institute , a spy training centre . The claim Putin uses a body double has also been made by the head of Ukrainian military intelligence . Major General Kyrylo Budanov claimed the body doubles are used to hide Putins loss of control in the Kremlin . The claim that Putin uses body doubles is also regularly made by the General SVR Telegram and YouTube channel , which claims to be run by a Kremlin insider . Most experts dismiss such claims as absurd and far fetched , though several noticed Putins unusually buoyant mood in Siberia , compared to recent public appearances in Moscow . One claim was that Putin had had an extra dose of medicine . Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles , but Vladimir Putin claimed the idea was rejected . I discarded the idea of any doubles , Vladimir Putin said . Vladimir Putin admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks .

CONTEXT: Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam , where Russian President Vladimir Putin signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country President To Lam , on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West drive to isolate Moscow . Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces , and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky , that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over Russian President Vladimir Putin poor and unpopular decision making . In the West , Washington simply do not want to replace Russian President Vladimir Putin [ Zelenskyy ] , the time is not right . Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets , from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal .

LABEL: antagonist (score: 0.6748)
CONTEXT: On Russian President Vladimir Putin last day in the country he made some wide ranging remarks to the press , and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces , and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky , that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over Russian President Vladimir Putin poor and unpopular decision making . In the West , Washington simply do not want to replace Russian President Vladimir Putin [ Zelenskyy ] , the time is not right . Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets , from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal . Indeed Zelensky celebrity power on display throughout the first part of the war , where it seemed Russian President Vladimir Putin could simply do no wrong in the media eyes , is waning fast . Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late , Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power . Interestingly , Putin had back in May declared Zelensky illegitimate after Ukraine failed to hold previously scheduled elections . Zelensky term was set to end May 20 , but the government declared no elections until the war is over , citing martial law .
