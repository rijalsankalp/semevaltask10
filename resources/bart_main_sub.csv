However , Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory . In Russian dictator Vladimir Putin opinion , the Ukrainian offensive showed the cowardice of the allies , especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer . And although all of Putin so called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation , each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long range missiles , tanks , or combat aircraft was reluctant , half hearted , inadequate , and gripped by fear . The fact is that Putin knew that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons . What Western leaders do not realize is that when you are facing a tyrant like Putin , escalation is the only language the colonel fears and understands . But especially US President Joe Biden unconvincing no will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran expected missile attack , just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine , Sir Richard Kemp said ."
